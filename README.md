# AWS Account

Before we get started with anything else, you need to create an account with Amazon Web Services (AWS). You want to do this as soon as possible as you will need it for much of the work in this course and it might take some time to authorize your account.

There are lots of other great vendors out there, but AWS is by far the leader in the space and so it is good for you to get experience with them. Follow these instructions on how to an [account with AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/). When you create your account make sure you remember your account ID so that you can use it when you log in to the AWS browser console.

## What is this going to cost you?

There is no cost to create an account with AWS, you only pay for what you use, and in many cases they will give you a significant starting credit, and [some services are free](https://aws.amazon.com/free) for a short period of time or monthly usage. The services we are going to use include the following:

| Service        | Purpose                              | Estimated Cost (subject to change)                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EC2            | Server                               | t3.nano $0.0052 an hour ($3.50/month), t3.micro $0.0104 an hour ($7.00/month), t3.small $0.0208 an hour ($14.00/month) |
| EC2 Elastic IP | Keep your IP address between reboots | First one is free if you keep it associated with a running server. $0.0052 an hour otherwise.                          |
| Route 53       | Domain name                          | $3/year for `click` TLD. More for others                                                                               |
| Route 53       | DNS records                          | $0.50 a month for each root domain                                                                                     |
|                |                                      | Estimated total: `$15` - `$50` for the course. Much cheaper than a textbook.                                           |

There are lots of ways to get free usage of services. For example, as of when this was written, you can get a 750 hours a month, for the first 12 months, of a Linux t2.micro server instance.
